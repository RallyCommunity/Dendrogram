My Inventory
=========================

## Overview
This app will look in the current project context for portfolio items. It will then attempt to show a dendogram style ancestral tree.

The advanced filters are available to select the items of the type chosen in the 'starting' level of portfolio item. Clicking on a green dot will give you further info for that item
