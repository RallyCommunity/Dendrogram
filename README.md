My Inventory Explorer
=========================

## Overview
This app will look in the current project context for portfolio items. It will then attempt to show a dendogram style ancestral tree.

The advanced filters are available to select the items of the type chosen in the 'starting' level of portfolio item. 

Clicking on a item's dot will give you further info for that item, e.g. the card info and the children. This gives you the ability to explore and to find out issues and exceptions.
